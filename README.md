There will be a Google Hangout available for the locations listed below to join. If you have a group joining from another location (with at least 2 attendees), let me know and I'll reserve a spot for you in the Hangout. I'm going to try to limit single attendees from joining the hangout since there is an upper limit of 10.
Several locations have volunteered meatspaces for attendees to congregate. These include:

- CentreSource (Feel free to show up)

- Center615 (RSVP @R_Macy on twitter)

- Stratasan

We're looking for additional locations in other parts of town. Let me know if you have a space you'd be willing to volunteer. I'd like to try to find locations in Brentwood and West Nashville.

We're trying this format as an experiment. Do be patient while we work out the kinks.

If you have any questions contact me in IRC: arafatm in #nashdl.
